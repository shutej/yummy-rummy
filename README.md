yummy-rummy
===========

My wife Sarah, for reason, loved Yummy Rummy.  She loved it so much she refused
to order from GrubHub after they canceled it!  Now our food is delivered via
Seamless.

I put together this game as an exercise for how to deploy a single
multi-platform application that runs similarly everywhere.
